# C - Sorting Algorithm

### In this project we explore concepts such as:
- Time Complexities and how they affect our programs
- Best case, worst case, and average case time complexities and their appropriate notations- Sorting algorithms (Merge, insertion, bubble, and quick sort, etc.)
- Importance of sorting algorithms and how to choose which one to work with
