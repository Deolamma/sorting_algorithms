# C - Sorting Algorithms
### In this project we explore concepts such as:
- Time Complexities and how they affect our programs
- Best case, worst case, and average case time complexities and their appropriate notations
- Sorting algorithms (Merge, insertion, bubble, and quick sort, etc.)
- Importance of sorting algorithms and how to choose which one to work with
